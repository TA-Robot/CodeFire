# Experiment Platform Design

## DES-AUTO-001: Experiment plan record

`ExperimentPlan` evolves from the current dataclass into a durable record with:

- plan ID
- hypothesis ID
- benchmark ID
- baseline ID
- metric definition
- command or runner reference
- resource budget
- artifact contract
- analysis checklist

## DES-AUTO-002: Runner abstraction

The runner interface has three phases:

1. prepare workspace
2. execute command
3. collect artifacts

The first runner is local process execution. Later runners can target containers, GPU machines, or queue systems without changing planner logic.

## DES-AUTO-003: Artifact contract

Each experiment declares expected artifacts before execution.

Required first artifacts:

- `metrics.json`
- `run.log`
- `config.json`
- `environment.json`
- `analysis.md`

Missing artifacts classify the run as incomplete rather than failed science.

## DES-AUTO-004: Result ingestion pipeline

Result ingestion parses artifacts into structured records, validates schema, normalizes metrics, and writes analysis notes.

Raw artifacts remain immutable. Derived summaries can be regenerated.

## DES-AUTO-005: Benchmark registry

Benchmarks are described by:

- task
- dataset
- split
- metric
- direction
- baseline references
- known pitfalls
- validation protocol

The registry is part of research memory, not hard-coded runner logic.

## DES-AUTO-006: Baseline registry

Baselines are versioned and linked to evidence.

Baseline records distinguish:

- imported literature number
- reproduced local number
- internal previous best
- sanity-check baseline

## DES-AUTO-007: Queue scheduler

The scheduler orders experiments by priority score, dependency readiness, expected information gain, and budget.

It can defer expensive experiments until cheaper probes support them.

## DES-AUTO-008: Analysis workflow

The analyst produces a structured analysis:

- summary
- metric comparison
- confidence
- failure classification
- suspected mechanism
- next action
- claim readiness update

This makes results useful for future planning rather than merely storing metrics.

## DES-AUTO-009: Experiment triage board

The triage board consumes compact decision signals rather than raw logs:

- plan ID
- priority
- expected information gain
- estimated cost
- promotion decision
- learning trend
- open blocker count
- rationale

It produces ranked actions:

- `run` for ready high-value experiments within budget
- `replicate` for promising but under-confirmed or unstable candidates
- `mutate` for plateaued or insufficient-improvement candidates
- `promote` for candidates that meet promotion gates
- `reject` for confident regressions
- `hold` for blocked or over-budget work

The ranking score is deterministic and cost-aware so repeated planning with the same state returns the same action order.

## DES-AUTO-010: Experiment iteration planner

The iteration planner consumes the same compact signals as the triage board and produces a plan with three lanes:

- `active` for experiments that should run, replicate, or mutate in the next iteration
- `review` for promotion or rejection decisions that need claim, evidence, or human review before changing campaign state
- `deferred` for blocked, over-budget, or lower-ranked work that should remain visible but not consume the next iteration

The planner enforces:

- non-negative remaining budget
- positive active capacity
- deterministic ordering from the triage score
- budget accounting based on estimated experiment cost
- review capacity so promotion/rejection work cannot crowd out execution planning

## DES-AUTO-011: Experiment risk register

The risk register stores compact risk records:

- risk ID
- related plan ID
- category
- severity
- probability
- impact
- status
- mitigation

The register exposes:

- a deterministic priority order for open risks
- a blocker view for critical or high-risk open items
- a mitigation checklist for the next research iteration

Risk priority is computed without hidden mutable state so repeated planning produces the same ordering for the same risk set.

## DES-AUTO-012: Experiment evidence pack

The evidence pack builder consumes compact promotion evidence rather than raw logs:

- plan ID
- candidate ID
- improvement over baseline
- confidence
- replication count
- stale evidence count
- blocker risk count
- missing artifact count
- mitigation notes

It produces:

- a readiness decision: `ready`, `review`, or `blocked`
- a deterministic completeness score
- blocking reasons that must be resolved before promotion
- review notes for non-blocking weaknesses
- a mitigation checklist ordered by input order

The builder is intentionally conservative. Blocker risks or missing required artifacts produce `blocked`; stale evidence or low replication produce `review`; only candidates with sufficient confidence, replication, fresh evidence, and no blockers become `ready`.

## DES-AUTO-013: Claim review queue

The claim review queue consumes compact evidence packs and reviewer objection counts rather than raw experiment logs.

Each review request includes:

- claim ID
- candidate ID
- evidence pack readiness
- open reviewer objection count
- blocking reviewer objection count
- assigned reviewer count

The queue produces:

- a decision: `approve`, `revise`, or `block`
- a deterministic priority score
- action reasons ordered from most severe to least severe
- a checklist combining evidence-pack mitigations with reviewer follow-up

Decision rules are intentionally conservative:

- evidence-pack `blocked` or any blocking objection produces `block`
- evidence-pack `review`, open non-blocking objections, or no assigned reviewer produces `revise`
- only readiness `ready`, no open objections, and at least one reviewer produces `approve`

Blocked items rank before revision items, and revision items rank before approval-ready items. Ties are broken by descending priority score and then stable claim ID.
