# Experiment Platform Design

## DES-AUTO-001: Experiment plan record

`ExperimentPlan` evolves from the current dataclass into a durable record with:

- plan ID
- hypothesis ID
- benchmark ID
- baseline ID
- metric definition
- command or runner reference
- resource budget
- artifact contract
- analysis checklist

## DES-AUTO-002: Runner abstraction

The runner interface has three phases:

1. prepare workspace
2. execute command
3. collect artifacts

The first runner is local process execution. Later runners can target containers, GPU machines, or queue systems without changing planner logic.

## DES-AUTO-003: Artifact contract

Each experiment declares expected artifacts before execution.

Required first artifacts:

- `metrics.json`
- `run.log`
- `config.json`
- `environment.json`
- `analysis.md`

Missing artifacts classify the run as incomplete rather than failed science.

## DES-AUTO-004: Result ingestion pipeline

Result ingestion parses artifacts into structured records, validates schema, normalizes metrics, and writes analysis notes.

Raw artifacts remain immutable. Derived summaries can be regenerated.

## DES-AUTO-005: Benchmark registry

Benchmarks are described by:

- task
- dataset
- split
- metric
- direction
- baseline references
- known pitfalls
- validation protocol

The registry is part of research memory, not hard-coded runner logic.

## DES-AUTO-006: Baseline registry

Baselines are versioned and linked to evidence.

Baseline records distinguish:

- imported literature number
- reproduced local number
- internal previous best
- sanity-check baseline

## DES-AUTO-007: Queue scheduler

The scheduler orders experiments by priority score, dependency readiness, expected information gain, and budget.

It can defer expensive experiments until cheaper probes support them.

## DES-AUTO-008: Analysis workflow

The analyst produces a structured analysis:

- summary
- metric comparison
- confidence
- failure classification
- suspected mechanism
- next action
- claim readiness update

This makes results useful for future planning rather than merely storing metrics.

## DES-AUTO-009: Experiment triage board

The triage board consumes compact decision signals rather than raw logs:

- plan ID
- priority
- expected information gain
- estimated cost
- promotion decision
- learning trend
- open blocker count
- rationale

It produces ranked actions:

- `run` for ready high-value experiments within budget
- `replicate` for promising but under-confirmed or unstable candidates
- `mutate` for plateaued or insufficient-improvement candidates
- `promote` for candidates that meet promotion gates
- `reject` for confident regressions
- `hold` for blocked or over-budget work

The ranking score is deterministic and cost-aware so repeated planning with the same state returns the same action order.
